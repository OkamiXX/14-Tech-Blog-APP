## Description:üìö
```
This is a project in which various technologies are applied to create Tech Blog application with user log ins and log outs. The main objective of this project is to demonstarte the skills to create a full website with frontend and backend. 

The blog application lets the user see previous posts from other users, interact by commenting on their posts and they can also create one of their own. For that they may need to sign up for a new username and password in order to create, edit or delete a post.
